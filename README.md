# JS-Password-Generator

In this task I was to create the JavaScript needed to generate a random password, using alerts, confirms, and prompts. Getting started was the toughest part. I stared at my JS template that was provided for an hour before writing any code. After doing a lot of research and playing around with previous activities, I was able to create something I'm pretty happy with. I added more notes as to what I did for each step as I realize I didn't do this much in the previous assignment.

It felt good seeing it all come together and work properly. Just from this week I can tell there's still so much to learn with Java Script. The toughest part of this assignment for me was getting the password parameters to work. Once I got them to work it really helped me get through the rest with ease. Excited for the next challenge ahead!
